# awaitable _and_ callable functions

How do you create a function which can be awaited, in which case it has one set of behaviour, or called directly, in which case it has another?

I asked [this very question on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58564687/test-if-coroutine-was-awaited-or-not/58567980#58567980) and got a great answer. This is the answer.

The first commit is the answer posted. The second commit is the answer in the comments.
